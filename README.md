## Overview

Welcome to my Data Professional Survey Breakdown project! In this project, I've utilized POWER BI to analyze a survey of data professionals. The analysis covers a wide range of insights, including average salary by job, country of participants, favorite programming language, difficulty of breaking into the data field, and overall job and salary satisfaction.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Source:** I used a comprehensive survey dataset containing responses from data professionals worldwide.
- **POWER BI:** I harnessed the power of POWER BI to create interactive visualizations and insightful dashboards.
- **Analysis:** Through the analysis, I aimed to uncover trends and patterns within the data professional community.
